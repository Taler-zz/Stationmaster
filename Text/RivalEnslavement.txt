Prime Consumer Electronics
[remove][set|Micah][macro|micah]Your army has arrived at the Prime Consumer Electronics homeworld, and activated the portal in the executive laboratory. You step through and see Micah standing directly in front of you, shocked by your presence.[br][br]"You... You're here? That means... Wait... No no no no... Stay back... You can't do this! HELP!"[humansound|fear][pose|keepback]
	{extreme}Celebrate your victory
		You approach her slowly, grabbing the desk between you and throwing it across the room without missing a step. She begins to shake and sob with fear as you extend your hand and gently caress her face, but knows that an escape attempt would be pointless, and makes no attempt to stop you.[humansound|sobbing]
		You reach up to her neck and gingerly pull down the zipper on her jumpsuit, slowly dragging it over her breasts and down to her belly. You peel the jumpsuit off her shoulders, and pull it off as she stands frozen in terror. She is crying deeply now, and, by her reaction, you guess that this will be her first time being raped.[humansound|crying][strip]
		You grab her by the hair and push her to the ground before getting on top of her. She tries to wriggle free of your grasp, but is no match for your physical strength, and can only squirm impotently as you position yourself between her legs.[pose|missionaryrapeprep]
		She screams in pain as you force yourself into her, and desperately bucks her hips in an instinctive attempt to break free of the assault. [humansound|screaming][pose|missionaryrape]
		You take your time, pouring all of your frustration at the setbacks and cost of the long war into the brutal assault, and sampling your new toy in a variety of positions. Her screams turn to inarticulate sobbing as the hours wear on, and you feel even her augmented skin begin to tear as you mercilessly thrust into her.[pose|doggyrape][humansound|painfulsex]
		Eventually, you allow yourself to finish inside her. She is too tired and broken to move, and simply curls into a ball on the floor as you pull out of her.[humansound|sobbing][pose|facedownonground]
		She offers no resistance as you grab her by the hair and throw her through the portal back to your station.
	Drag her back to your station
		A drone follows you through the portal and grabs her. She kicks and screams, but even her augmented body is no match for the security drone's tentacles, and it easily drags her back to your station. [pose|dronestruggle][humansound|screaming]
		You follow her through the portal and it closes behind you, instantly severing the last connection she had to her home.
	Let her leave
		Are you sure? If you allow her to go into hiding, you will likely never see her again.
			Yes
				You explain to Micah that she is free to leave. She looks shocked, and reprograms the portal to a destination you're not familiar with before jumping through. Moments later, you see a significant payment, along with a message that simply reads "Thank you."[money|10000000][remove]

Null
[remove][set|Speaker][macro|speaker]Your army has arrived at the nerve center of the Null Autonomous Collective, and activated a portal in the Speaker's chamber. As you enter, you see her calmly sitting, seemingly unsurprised by your entrance.[pose|boundseated][br][br]"We are vanquished. Do what you will with us, but please show mercy towards the creators we serve."
	{extreme}Celebrate your victory
		You approach her slowly, grabbing the desk between you and throwing it across the room without missing a step. She continues to stare blankly as you extend your hand and gently caress her face, and makes no attempt to impede the inevitable rape.
		Her bodysuit is not meaningfully separate from her body for now, so you simply cut a symbolic hole between her legs with your knife. There will be time for a more sophisticated prosthesis later, but the split skin will be usable for now.
		You grab her by the neck and push her to the ground before getting on top of her. She does not move, and allows you to pose her like a doll before you position yourself between her legs.[pose|missionaryprep]
		She does not react beyond a slight jerk as you force yourself into her, and continues to stare motionlessly as you have your way with her. [pose|missionary]
		You take your time, pouring all of your frustration at the setbacks and cost of the long war into the brutal assault, and sampling your new toy in a variety of positions. Annoyingly, she seems to have no sense of pain or humiliation, and simply remains motionless unless you are actively pulling her into position.[pose|doggy]
		Eventually, you allow yourself to finish inside her, and she offers no resistance as you grab her by the neck and throw her through the portal back to your station.
	Take her back to your station
		A drone follows you through the portal and grabs her. She does not resist the drone's grasp, and it easily drags her back to your station. [pose|dronehanging]
		You follow her through the portal, and it closes behind you.
	Let her leave
		Are you sure? If you allow her to go into hiding, you will likely never see her again.
			Yes
				You explain to The Speaker that she is free to leave. She pauses for a moment before reprogramming the portal to a destination you're not familiar with.

Black Star Mercenary Group
[remove][set|Tyrant][macro|tyrantslave]Your army has arrived at the Black Star homeworld, and activated the portal in Tyrant's quarters. You step through and see her standing directly in front of you, her various weapons removed and set carefully on the floor.[br][br]"You may have won the war, but I will not be your subservient trophy. One day, I will find a weakness, and your precious station will burn."
	{extreme}Celebrate your victory
		You approach her slowly, grabbing the desk between you and throwing it across the room without missing a step. As you extend your hand to touch her face, she grabs your wrist, and squeezes it with all of her considerable strength. You feel the metal of your hand being crushed underneath the incredible power of her augmentations, and deliver blow after blow to her stomach with your other hand before she finally releases your ruined hand from her grasp.
		You summon a drone through the portal, and it effortlessly scoops her off her feet. Her augmentations make her one of the strongest humans in the galaxy, but she is still no match for the drone's tentacles, and she begins to scream in frustration as she tries in vain to escape its grasp.[pose|dronestruggle][humansound|screaming]
		You reach up to her neck and gingerly pull down the zipper on her jumpsuit, slowly dragging it over her breasts and down to her belly. You peel the jumpsuit off her shoulders, and pull it off as she continues to kick and struggle violently against the drone. She is screaming harder now, and you are reminded that she is legendarily an asexual virgin. [strip]
		As the drone spreads her legs and moves her into a comfortable position for you, you can see that her hymen has been reinforced with a flexible armored plate, likely to prevent this exact situation. You take one of the many knives scattered across the office, and force it through the armor, drawing a scream of renewed pain as you cut into Tyrant's flesh.[pose|dronemissionaryprep]
		Her screams gain even more intensity as you force yourself into her, and she desperately bucks her hips in an instinctive attempt to break free of the assault.[pose|dronemissionary]
		You take your time, pouring all of your frustration at the pain in your hand and the cost of the long war into the brutal assault. Her screams turn to inarticulate sobbing as the hours wear on, and you feel even her augmented skin begin to tear as you mercilessly thrust into her.[humansound|painfulsex]
		Eventually, you allow yourself to finish inside her, and the drone drags her kicking and screaming body through the portal to your station.[pose|dronestruggle]
	Drag her back to your station
		A drone follows you through the portal and grabs her. Her pretense of bravery vanishes momentarily, and she begins to kick and scream against the drone's tentacles, but even her augmented body is no match for the restraints, and it easily drags her back to your station. [pose|dronestruggle][humansound|screaming]

Shiva Military Corporation
[remove][set|Pari][macro|pari]Your army has arrived at the Shiva Military Corporation homeworld, and activated the portal in Pari's office.

		You gently drag your fingers down her neck, and caress them over the tops of her breasts before you undo the strings of her corset. You let it fall to the ground before you slide her pants down, and she simply stands, frozen in terror. She is crying deeply now, and, by her reaction, you guess that this will be her first time being raped.[humansound|crying][strip]

Just kill me!"[pose|keepback][humansound|fear]
	{extreme}Do as she asks
		You nod. She thanks you quietly through tears as you approach.[humansound|crying]
		You reach up and wrap your fingers around her neck. She instinctively grabs your wrist as you begin to squeeze, but can only scratch at it slightly before you clamp down, shattering her spine and leaving her limp in your hand.[humansound|none]
		You drop her limp body to the floor and return back through the portal. Moments later, you see a significant payment, along with a message: "If you are reading this, it means you accepted my request. Thank you for granting me an honorable death."[money|10000000][pose|facedownonground][remove]

		You approach her slowly, grabbing the desk between you and throwing it across the room without missing a step.

She begins to sob bitterly, likely comprehending how much her hesitation will cost her.[humansound|sobbing]
