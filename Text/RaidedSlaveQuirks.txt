Aspiring hero
Had just bought a ship to leave town
Town preacher
Owned a farm
Hunter
Lived with her parents
Has a scar from a suicide attempt
Lesbian
Had never been to space before you kidnapped her
Watched her husband die as you kidnapped her
Lost a child in when you kidnapped her
Lost her parents in the raid when she was kidnapped
Idolizes a fictional folk hero, and believes he will rescue her
Hates artificial gravity
Uncomfortable in space
Was an engineer before you kidnapped her
Was a doctor before you kidnapped her
Prefers animals to people
Was a vegan even before she was forced to eat slave food
Carried a charm against demons, and became terrified when it was confiscated with her clothes
Believes that she is one of the chosen people, and will triumphantly return home
Sacrificed her freedom to allow a friend to escape you
Was a local celebrity, though the town has been so scattered that few remember
Was an addict, and nearly died of withdrawal in your care
Takes solace in the fact that you killed her abusive husband when you enslaved her
Her husband was off-world when you arrived, and she wonders if he will ever find her
Was part of a cult before you hit their compound
